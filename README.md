# StimEval

**StimEval** is a cross-platform application for the presentation and evaluation of image, video, and audio stimuli.  
It allows researchers to display and collect subjective ratings of responses in a controlled environment.

Built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app), [React](https://react.dev), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), StimEval is lightweight, privacy-friendly, and runs natively on all major operating systems.

**Note:** 
This build is currently unsigned, so some operating systems may display a warning such as “Possible dangerous app” or “Unknown publisher” when launching the installer.
This is normal for open-source software without a paid code-signing certificate.
You can safely proceed by selecting “More info → Run anyway.”
The app is fully open-source, and its integrity can be verified using the attached SHA256 checksums.
