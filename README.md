# StimEval

**StimEval** is a cross-platform application for the presentation and evaluation of emotional stimuli.  
It allows researchers to display images and collect subjective ratings of emotional or cognitive responses in a controlled environment.

Built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app), [React](https://react.dev), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), StimEval is lightweight, privacy-friendly, and runs natively on all major operating systems.
